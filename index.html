        <h1>Recipe for Disaster</h1>
        <p>What’s a recipe for disaster? Not planning your work out before you do it. Not user testing. Not having a good explanation for why you did what you did. Design by committee. Here’s how you can create your own disaster using everyday ingredients you probably have around you right now.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>One project</li>
            <li>A vague idea of what the stakeholders want</li>
            <li>A group of stakeholders</li>
            <li>“Pop”</li>
            <li>A completely unrelated relative, such as a nephew</li>
            <li>A Very Important Person</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <img src="assets/Image 6.png" alt="">
                <p>Begin by making a mockup of your web design using the project and vague ideas. Optional: make several mockups.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <img src="assets/Image 7.png" alt="">
                <p>Mix the mockup with the stakeholders. You’ll see a significant reaction. Allow this to simmer for about 20 minutes.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <img src="assets/Image 5.png" alt="">
                <p>At this time, someone will request more “pop”. Add the pop now, and allow to rest for 2-3 days, or until work is doubled.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <img src="assets/Image 9.png" alt="">
                <p>After work is doubled, allow stakeholders to bring in completely unrelated relative for feedback. Mix the ten year old nephew’s feedback with the mockup, stirring carefully. Allow to rest for 2-3 more days.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <img src="assets/Image 8.png" alt="">
                <p>Add the Very Important Person. Once added, they should question what on earth happened. Allow design to deflate once more, and then rise again until doubled, but this time in the way Very Important Person wants.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <img src="assets/Image 10.png" alt="">
                <p>Bake the design at 350<sup>&deg;</sup> F for 20 minutes, or until it won’t move anymore. Have someone try it. At this point, it should be pretty awful.</p>
            </li>
            <li>Enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
